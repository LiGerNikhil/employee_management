## Logging Implementation

### Check-In Logging:
```python
# Success
AttendanceLog.objects.create(
    employee=employee,
    action='check_in_success',
    success=True,
    confidence=result['confidence'],
    ip_address=get_client_ip(request),
    user_agent=request.META.get('HTTP_USER_AGENT'),
    attendance=attendance,
    notes=f'Check-in successful with {confidence}% confidence'
)

# Failure
AttendanceLog.objects.create(
    employee=employee,
    action='check_in_failed',
    success=False,
    failure_reason='face_not_matched',
    confidence=result['confidence'],
    ip_address=get_client_ip(request),
    user_agent=request.META.get('HTTP_USER_AGENT'),
    notes=f'Face verification failed'
)
```

### Check-Out Logging:
Same structure as check-in, with `check_out_success` and `check_out_failed` actions.

    models.Index(fields=['employee', '-timestamp']),
    models.Index(fields=['action', '-timestamp']),
]
```

### Query Optimization:
```python
logs = AttendanceLog.objects.select_related(
    'employee', 
    'attendance'
).order_by('-timestamp')
```
