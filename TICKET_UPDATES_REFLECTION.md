# Ticket Updates Reflection - Fixed ✅

## Issue
When admin changed ticket status or added comments, the changes were not reflected/visible in the employee dashboard.

## Root Cause
1. Employee needed to refresh the page to see updates
2. No automatic notification about status changes
3. No visual indicator for updated tickets
4. Comments were being saved correctly but employees didn't know about updates

## Solutions Implemented

### 1. ✅ Automatic Status Change Comments
When admin changes ticket status, an automatic comment is created that's visible to the employee.

**Example:**
```
Admin changes status from "Open" to "In Progress"
↓
Automatic comment created:
"Status changed from 'Open' to 'In Progress' | Priority updated to 'High'"
```

**Code:**
```python
if old_status != new_status:
    status_comment = f"Status changed from '{old_status}' to '{new_status}'"
    TicketComment.objects.create(
        ticket=ticket,
        user=request.user,
        comment=status_comment,
        is_internal=False  # Visible to employee
    )
```

### 2. ✅ Clear Admin Feedback
Admin now gets clear messages about visibility:

**For Public Comments:**
- ✅ "Comment added successfully. Employee will see this comment."

**For Internal Notes:**
- ✅ "Internal note added (not visible to employee)."

**For Status Updates:**
- ✅ "Ticket updated successfully. Employee will see the status change."

### 3. ✅ Visual Update Indicators

**In Employee Ticket List:**
- 🔔 "Updated" badge appears on tickets that have been modified
- Badge shows when `updated_at` differs from `created_at`
- Cyan/info color for visibility

**In Ticket Detail Page:**
- 📢 "New Activity" alert at top
- Shows last updated time
- Blue badge highlights new activity

### 4. ✅ Comment Visibility Logic

**Employee Sees:**
- ✅ All public comments (is_internal=False)
- ✅ Admin replies
- ✅ Automatic status change notifications
- ✅ Their own comments

**Employee Does NOT See:**
- ❌ Internal admin notes (is_internal=True)
- ❌ Admin-only discussions

## How It Works Now

### Admin Updates Ticket:

**Step 1: Admin Changes Status**
```
Admin: Changes status from "Open" to "In Progress"
System: Creates automatic comment
Database: ticket.updated_at = now()
```

**Step 2: Employee Refreshes Page**
```
Employee: Opens "My Tickets"
Display: 🔔 "Updated" badge appears
Employee: Clicks to view ticket
Display: "New Activity" alert shown
Display: Sees automatic status change comment
```

### Admin Adds Comment:

**Public Comment (Checkbox OFF):**
```
Admin: Types "We're working on this issue"
Admin: Leaves "Internal Note" unchecked
System: is_internal = False
Employee: Can see this comment
```

**Internal Note (Checkbox ON):**
```
Admin: Types "Need to check with IT team"
Admin: Checks "Internal Note"
System: is_internal = True
Employee: Cannot see this note
```
