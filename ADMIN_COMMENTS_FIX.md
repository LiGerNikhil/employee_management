# Admin Comments Display - Fixed ✅

## Issue
Admin couldn't view comments posted by employees in the ticket management modal.

## Solution
Added a comments section to the admin ticket modal that displays all comments with proper formatting.

## What Was Added

### Comments Display Section
Located in the admin ticket modal, showing:
- ✅ All comments (employee and admin)
- ✅ User identification (Employee vs Admin)
- ✅ Admin badge with shield icon
- ✅ Employee name with user icon
- ✅ Internal note badge (for admin-only comments)
- ✅ Timestamp for each comment
- ✅ Scrollable area (max 300px height)
- ✅ Color-coded:
  - 🔴 Red text for Admin comments
  - 🔵 Blue text for Employee comments
  - 🟡 Yellow badge for Internal Notes

### Features

**Comment Display:**
```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────┐
